# Keyfillium
**This is a work in progress, the code has not yet been made**

Generate thousands of fake rsa/openssh/etc keyfiles, security by obscurity: the right way.

**What is this?**

A simple tool to generate a custom amount of fake ssh/rsa/any keyfile of your choice.

**Why?**

Its incredibly useful in scenarios where your device is compromised, the cloud provider is compromised etc. 
An attacker wouldnt be able to identify the right combination of keyfiles within an endless amount.

**But... storage?**

Keyfiles only take a couple kilobytes of storage, its up to you how many you make.
